# Experimental Models

This folder contains different deep learning models experimented with for hair type classification. These models include:

- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks):** Basic deep learning architecture tested for classification.
- **VGG (Visual Geometry Group Network):** A deeper architecture used for comparison.
- **DenseNet (Densely Connected Convolutional Networks):** The most optimized model used in the final implementation.

Each model was trained and evaluated to determine the best performing one for the final application.
